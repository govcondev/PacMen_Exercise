# PacMen Exercise

## Project Description
This PacMen Exercise is a JavaScript project housed in this repository, designed to build front-end and back-end development skills. In this exercise you use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, to create a dynamic webpage where users can control multiple PacMen characters moving across the screen. DOM manipulation, and object-oriented programming principles are used to enable PacMen to change direction upon collision with the screen edges.

### How to Run
**Open the HTML file in your browser**
   - Simply double-click the `index.html` file to open it in your default web browser.
   - Alternatively, you can open the file directly from your browser's file menu.

### Roadmap of Future Improvements 
1. **Responsive Design:** Enhance the UI for better compatibility with various screen sizes.
2. **PacMen Varieties:** Introduce different types of PacMen with unique behaviors.
3. **Performance Optimization:** Optimize animation performance for smoother interaction.
