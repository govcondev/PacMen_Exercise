# PacMen Exercise

## Project Description
This PacMen Exercise is a JavaScript project housed in this repository, designed to build front-end and back-end development skills. In this exercise you use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, to create a dynamic webpage where users can control multiple PacMen characters moving across the screen. DOM manipulation, and object-oriented programming principles are used to enable PacMen to change direction upon collision with the screen edges.
